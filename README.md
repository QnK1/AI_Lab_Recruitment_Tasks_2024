# AI Lab Recruitment Tasks 2024
Dear Candidate,

We are pleased to inform you that you are about to begin the recruitment test for membership at AI Lab. Please ensure that you have a quiet space and all necessary materials before starting.

The test will assess your skills and suitability for the position, and it is expected to take approximately one week to complete. We encourage you to read the instructions carefully before proceeding.

To submit your solutions, you must fork the AI_Lab_Recruitment_Tasks_2024 repository. Remember to make it private and add AI Lab members as collaborators: <a href="https://github.com/bjam24">bjam24</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BartekKruczek">BartekKruczek</a>.

Further information about this test may be available in the repository's README file.

If you encounter any issues during the test or have any additional questions, feel free to contact us at ailab@agh.edu.pl.

By participating in this recruitment, you agree to uphold the integrity of the process. In case of any dishonesty or attempts to cheat (e.g using ChatGPT, copying work), your candidacy will be disqualified, and your application will no longer be processed.

We wish you the best of luck and thank you for your interest in joining our team!

Best regards,

AI Lab Recruitment Team
